# Week 2 â€“ Joins & Data Modeling

**Dataset:** Chinook Music Database

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts
- INNER / LEFT / RIGHT / FULL joins  
- Self-joins for comparisons  
- Schema design (Star vs Snowflake)  
- Normalization and keys (1NFâ€“3NF)

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Objectives
1. Combine data from multiple tables using different join types  
2. Understand primary and foreign key relationships  
3. Model a fact-dimension schema for analytics

## ðŸ’» Practice Tasks
- Join Customer, Invoice, InvoiceLine, Track, and Genre tables  
- Calculate total spend per customer and per genre  
- Normalize Artist/Album relationships to 3NF

## ðŸ“ˆ Project Deliverable
**Music Sales Summary Report** in `/project/Music_Sales_Summary_Report.md`  
Create a denormalized summary table showing each customerâ€™s top genre and lifetime spend.
