# Week 5 â€“ Optimization & Feature Engineering

**Dataset:** Olist Brazilian E-Commerce (Kaggle)

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts
- Query optimization and `EXPLAIN` plans  
- Indexes and performance tuning  
- Temporary tables, views, and materialized views  
- Derived metrics for ML features (e.g., RFM scores)

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Objectives
1. Profile query performance and interpret execution plans  
2. Create and use indexes effectively  
3. Generate features for predictive models using SQL

## ðŸ’» Practice Tasks
- Compare execution time before/after adding indexes  
- Build RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) features for customers  
- Store aggregated results as a view for reuse

## ðŸ“ˆ Project Deliverable
**Churn Feature Engineering Report** in `/project/Churn_Feature_Engineering_Report.md`  
Includes SQL feature definitions and query optimization screenshots.

## ðŸ§  Reflection Prompt
How did indexes affect query performance?  
Which features might predict churn in a machine-learning model?
