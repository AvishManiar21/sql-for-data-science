# Week 1 â€“ Complex Queries & Analytical Thinking

**Dataset:** Superstore Sales (Kaggle)

## ðŸ”‘ Key Concepts
- Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)  
- Conditional logic using `CASE WHEN`  
- Aggregations and filtering with `HAVING`

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Objectives
1. Write nested queries and CTEs to organize complex logic  
2. Create calculated fields and conditional categories  
3. Summarize sales metrics (grouped by region, category, customer)

## ðŸ’» Practice Tasks
- Identify top-5 products by region using a subquery  
- Compute average discount and profit per category  
- Segment customers into Bronze/Silver/Gold tiers based on sales

## ðŸ“ˆ Project Deliverable
**Customer Spend Segmentation Report** in `/project/Customer_Spend_Segmentation_Report.md`  
Includes SQL logic, findings, and insights on customer categories.

## ðŸ§  Reflection Prompt
How did CTEs make your queries more readable than nested subqueries?  
What patterns did you discover in customer spending behavior?
